  instructions: "Define a method <code>addTwoNums</code> which takes in three <code>int</code> variables <b>by reference</b> and stores in the third variable the sum of the first two.  In other words, your method should take in 3 int* pointers.  You'll need to dereference all of them at some point to pull this off;"
  goals:
    - Work with pointers in C++
    - Pass values by reference to methods in C++
