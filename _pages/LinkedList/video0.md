Watch the video below that I dug up from fall 2020 to help you warm back up after spring break on static vs dynamic objects

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Object reference pitfall 1: you should only delete objects that you've allocated dynamically with a <code>new</code></li>
<li>Object reference pitfall 2: Since object values declared in a method are deleted when the method completes, you will get a segfault if you return and try to use references to them.</li>
</ul>
