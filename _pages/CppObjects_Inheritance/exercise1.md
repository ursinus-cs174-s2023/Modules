  instructions: "Fill in the celebrateNBirthdays() method to celebrate some number of birthdays on a particular Person object passed by reference.  Since you're working with a pointer to an object, you should use the arrow notation in a loop to call the celebrateBirthday() method on the object."
  goals:
    - Work classes and objects in C++
    - Work with dynamic object references in C++
