  instructions: "The code below starts you with a simple <code>Person</code> class.  Define a child class <code>Immortal</code> which inherits from parent, and whose constructor takes a single parameter of the name.  The age should always set to 999999999 when invoking the parent constructor."
  goals:
    - Work with classes and objects in C++
    - Use inheritance to share code between a parent and child class in C++
